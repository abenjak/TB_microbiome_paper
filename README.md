# TB_microbiome_paper

This is the repository of the analysis scripts and methods that were used in the paper **Multicenter analysis of pulmonary microbiota in tuberculosis patients** published in PlosONE.

The repository is organised by cohort. While we tried to provide as much details as possible, the repository is not entirely self-contained, i.e. most steps describled here start from processed reads. Raw reads are available at Sequence Read Archive under accession number [PRJNA611472](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA611472).
